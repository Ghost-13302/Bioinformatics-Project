# Bioinformatics Project: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) Tool Comparison

This project implements a pipeline to compare multiple sequence alignment (MSA) tools, focusing on **MUSCLE** and **Clustal Omega**, using the BAliBASE benchmark dataset (RV11 and RV12). The results are generated in `.msf` format for further scoring using external tools.

## Features
- **Tools Used**: MUSCLE (v3.8) and Clustal Omega.
- **Dataset**: BAliBASE RV11 and RV12 reference sets.
- **Output**: `.msf` alignment files for RV11 and RV12, stored in the `results` folder.
- **Scoring**: SP and TC scores calculated externally using `bali_score`.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```
3. Download and set up the following tools:
   - **MUSCLE v3.8** executable in the project directory.
   - **Clustal Omega** executable in the `clustal` directory.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Bioinformatics-Project.git
   cd Bioinformatics-Project
   ```
2. Place the BAliBASE RV11 and RV12 datasets in the `bb3_release` folder.
3. Run the `Algorithms.py` script:
   ```bash
   python Algorithms.py
   ```
4. The `.msf` results for both MUSCLE and Clustal Omega will be stored in the `results` folder.

## Scoring Process
Since SP (Sum-of-Pairs) and TC (Total Column) scores require properly formatted `.msf` files:
1. The generated `.msf` files were validated against BAliBASE reference alignments.
2. External scoring was performed using the **`bali_score`** tool:
   - Install `bali_score` by compiling it with the `expat` XML parser.
   - Run `bali_score` commands for each test case, e.g.:
     ```bash
     bali_score -ref bb3_release/RV11/BB11001.msf -test results/BB11001_muscle.msf
     bali_score -ref bb3_release/RV11/BB11001.msf -test results/BB11001_clustalo.msf
     ```
3. The SP and TC scores were recorded for analysis.

**Note**: We couldn't use `bali_score` for SP and TC scoring directly in cases where sequence lengths differed due to formatting limitations in `.msf` files generated by MUSCLE and Clustal Omega. Instead, those alignments were skipped or re-evaluated.

## Results
The results are stored as `.msf` files in the `results` folder. These alignments can be further evaluated using scoring tools. Detailed runtime and memory usage metrics were recorded for each tool.

## Directory Structure
```
Bioinformatics Project/
├── Algorithms.py          # Main script to run alignments
├── muscle.exe             # MUSCLE executable (v3.8)
├── clustal/               # Clustal Omega executable directory
├── bb3_release/           # BAliBASE datasets (RV11, RV12)
├── results/               # Output folder for .msf results
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Notes
- **MUSCLE v5** was not used because it does not produce `.msf` files required for BAliBASE scoring.
- Ensure the `.msf` files align with BAliBASE references for valid scoring.
